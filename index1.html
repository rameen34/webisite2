    <h1 style="text-align:center">The Pyramids</h1>

    <p>
        The pyramids in Egypt are really old and they were built for the kings (pharaohs) as tombs.
        They are made of huge stones and even today people wonder how they moved them without trucks.
        Historians love looking at them because they are so big and cool.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nobody knows exactly how they were built for sure. 
        Some people think they used big ramps and others think they used stars to line them up. 
        It took thousands of workers many years to finish just one pyramid!
    </p>

    <p>
        The Great Pyramid of Giza has secret rooms inside. 
        Scientists use new technology to find them now. 
        They think there is gold or maybe just old tools inside these rooms.
